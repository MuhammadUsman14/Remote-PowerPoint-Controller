# Introduction:
Remote PowerPoint Controller
To create a simple and inexpensive PowerPoint presentation remote controller.
# Background:
The group members researched about how they could make an inexpensive remote controller with easily found electric components.
# Circuit Diagram:
Functionality and Features:
The IR receiver will receive the signal from IR remote and forward it to the Arduino connected to the computer. The Arduino will then compare the signal with a list of commands and their IR signals through the program installed in it and determine which command to follow and the computer will execute the command.
 
User can start, move to next or previous slides, play or pause a video and end the PowerPoint presentation when the device is connected to a computer or laptop, with access of the remote control.
# Implementation and Testing:
Understanding the language for Arduino and programming the microcontroller board for this specific task was a challenge.
During the implementation, there were some problems faced such as the availability of the needed components and discovering a faulty component. The components were replaced with other suitable components.
# Project Breakdown Structure:
1st week – Understanding and programming the Arduino
2nd week – Making the needed components available and building the circuit
3rd week – Adding possible feature and ending the project
Results:
The project was completed after removing the mistakes and improving the project to its best level with all the features working.
# Conclusion:
The cost-effective device is made to control PowerPoint presentation efficiently. In future, we can add more controls in it.
